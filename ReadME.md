# Spring Boot Application

## Description

This repository contains a Spring Boot application designed to manage a system for meal orders and donations. The application features a range of functionalities including user management, role-based access control, and meal ordering. It provides a RESTful API and a web interface for users to interact with the system.

### Features

- **User Management:** Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. 
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiated access levels for administrators and regular users.
- **Meal Ordering:** Users can browse available meals, place orders, and view order history.
- **Donations:** Users can make donations to support meal services.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators can manage users, roles, and view system metrics.

### Technologies Used

- **Java:** Programming language used to build the application.
- **Spring Boot:** Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **MySQL:** Database for storing application data.
- **JSP:** Technology used for rendering views in the web interface.
- **Maven:** Build automation tool used for dependency management and project builds.

## Prerequisites

To run and deploy this application, you will need:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher:** Required to build and run the application.
- **Apache Maven:** Used for building and managing the application dependencies.
- **MySQL Database:** Required for storing application data.
- **Railway account (for deployment):** For deploying the application to the cloud.

## Running Locally

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get a copy of the application on your local machine, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```
## Step 2: Create Database Schema
```bash
CREATE SCHEMA `springboot_app_db` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;
```
### Step 3: Configure the Application
Update the src/main/resources/application.properties file with your database connection details:
```bash
# Server port
server.port=8080

# View resolver configuration
spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/views/
spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp

# Database configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/springboot_app_db
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

```
### Step 4: Build and Run the Application
Build the Application: Compile and package the application using Maven:
```bash

mvn clean install

```
Run the Application: Start the application with Maven:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

### Step 5: Insert Initial Data
```bash
-- Insert data into Role table
INSERT INTO `springboot_app_db`.`role` (`id`, `description`, `name`) VALUES ('1', 'for admin', 'Administrator');
INSERT INTO `springboot_app_db`.`role` (`id`, `description`, `name`) VALUES ('2', 'for user', 'User');

-- Insert data into User table
INSERT INTO `springboot_app_db`.`user` (`id`, `name`, `password`, `user_name`) VALUES ('1', 'admin', 'admin', 'admin');

-- Insert data into User Role table
INSERT INTO `springboot_app_db`.`user_role` (`user_id`, `role_id`) VALUES ('1', '1');

```
